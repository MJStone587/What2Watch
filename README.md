# What2Watch
ABOUT: This site was a project and idea I started while in school. It was originally built with php and a database. Since I cannot host or display a php/database site through github I thought I'd try changing the database into a json file and using an api call through javascript to grab the data. This way I'd gain some more experience using API calls and displaying it through javascript. 

WHY: The idea behind this site is to be able to add more movies/shows into the DB through an admin panel. Then display that information and allow users to write reviews etc. The original idea was very small but as I have begun to learn more I have added to it. This might be my largest project of everything I have done. The very first time I worked on this was in my first html/css course and it has slowly evolved from that point onward.

WIP: Site is a WIP and as yet is not a finished project.
