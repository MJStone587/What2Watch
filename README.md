# What2Watch
ABOUT: 

This site was a project and idea I started while in school. It was originally built with php and a database. Since I cannot host or display a php/database site through github I thought I'd try changing the database into a json file and using an api call through javascript to grab the data. This way I'd gain some more experience using API calls and displaying it through javascript.
